The Cricket Score Keeper project is a dynamic web application designed for maintaining and tracking cricket match scores. Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the React.js library,
this application provides an interactive and user-friendly interface for keeping track of runs, wickets, and
ball-by-ball details along with commentary during an international cricket match.


Key Features:

Live Score Display:

The application prominently displays the current score, including the total runs scored and the number of wickets fallen.
Interactive Score Buttons:

The user can easily update the score by clicking on interactive buttons corresponding to different scoring options - 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and Wicket.
Special styling is applied to emphasize boundaries (4s and 6s) and wickets.
Ball-wise Result and Commentary:

The project maintains a detailed record of ball-wise results, including the runs scored or wicket taken on each ball.
The commentary section allows users to add comments for each ball, providing context or additional information.
Form Submission:

Users can submit additional comments for each ball through a form. The input is processed and displayed in real-time, contributing to the ball-wise commentary.
Over-wise Details:

The application intelligently formats and presents ball-wise details, ensuring readability by inserting line breaks at the end of each over.
